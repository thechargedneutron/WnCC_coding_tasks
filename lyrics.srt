0
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,900
Look, I was gonna go easy on
you and not to hurt your
feelings

1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,400
But I'm only going to get this
one chance

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,700
Something's wrong, I can feel
it (Six minutes, Slim Shady,
you're on)

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,900
Just a feeling I've got, like
something's about to happen,
but I don't know what

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,300
If that means, what I think it
means, we're in trouble, big
trouble,

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
And if he is as bananas as you
say, I'm not taking any
chances

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,200
You were just what the doctor ordered

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm beginning to feel like a
Rap God, Rap God

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,300
All my people from the front
to the back nod, back nod

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Now who thinks their arms are
long enough to slap box, slap
box?

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,100
They said I rap like a robot,
so call me Rapbot

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,200
But for me to rap like a
computer must be in my genes

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,000
I got a laptop in my back pocket

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Made a living and a killing off it

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
Ever since Bill Clinton was
still in office

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
With Monica Lewinsky feeling
on his nut-sack

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm an MC still as honest

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,600
But as rude and indecent as
all hell syllables, killaholic
(Kill 'em all with)

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,100
You don't really wanna get
into a pissing match with this
rappidy rap

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,800
Packing a Mac in the back of
the Ac, pack backpack rap,
yep, yackidy-yac

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,400
The exact same time I attempt
these lyrical acrobat stunts
while I'm practicing

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,900
That I'll still be able to
break a motherfuckin' table

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,900
Over the back of a couple of
faggots and crack it in half

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,200
Only realized it was ironic I
was signed to Aftermath after
the fact

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,300
How could I not blow? All I do
is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath
of attack

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,700
Rappers are having a rough
time period, here's a Maxipad

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,300
It's actually disastrously bad

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,900
For the wack while I'm
masterfully constructing this
masterpiece as

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
I'm beginning to feel like a
Rap God, Rap God

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,300
All my people from the front
to the back nod, back nod

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,600
Now who thinks their arms are
long enough to slap box, slap
box?

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,200
Let me show you maintaining
this shit ain't that hard,
that hard

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,200
Everybody want the key and the
secret to rap immortality like
I have got

36
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Well, to be truthful the
blueprint's simply rage and
youthful exuberance

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,300
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,700
Hit the earth like an
asteroid, did nothing but
shoot for the moon since

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,100
MC's get taken to school with this music

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,100
Cause I use it as a vehicle to
bust a rhyme

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Now I lead a new school full of students

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Me? I'm a product of Rakim,
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,800
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren,
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they
got Slim

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Inspired enough to one day
grow up, blow up and be in a
position

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,500
To meet Run DMC and induct
them into the motherfuckin'
Rock n'

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Roll Hall of Fame

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,900
Even though I walk in the
church and burst in a ball of
flames

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,700
Only Hall of Fame I be
inducted in is the alcohol of
fame

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,900
On the wall of shame

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
You fags think it's all a game
'til I walk a flock of flames

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Off of planking, tell me what
in the fuck are you thinking?

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
Little gay looking boy

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
So gay I can barely say it
with a straight face looking
boy

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
You witnessing a massacre

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
Like you watching a church
gathering take place looking
boy

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,900
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's
all they say looking boy

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,200
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back

58
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
And a way to go from your
label everyday looking boy

59
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,600
Hey, looking boy, what you say
looking boy?

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
I'mma work for everything I have

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,400
Never ask nobody for shit, get
outta my face looking boy

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,100
Basically boy you're never
gonna be capable

64
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,800
To keep up with the same pace
looking boy

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,900
'Cause I'm beginning to feel
like a Rap God, Rap God

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,200
All my people from the front
to the back nod, back nod

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
The way I'm racing around the
track, call me Nascar, Nascar

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer
park, the White Trash God

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,100
Kneel before General Zod this
planet's Krypton, no Asgard,
Asgard

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,300
So you be Thor and I'll be
Odin, you rodent, I'm
omnipotent

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,700
Let off then I'm reloading
immediately with these bombs
I'm totin'

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
And I should not be woken

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm the walking dead, but I'm
just a talking head, a zombie
floating

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,200
But I got your mom deep throating

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm out my ramen noodle, we
have nothing in common, poodle

76
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself
in the arm and pay homage,
pupil

77
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,200
It's me, my honesty's brutal

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
But it's honestly futile if I
don't utilize what I do though

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
For good at least once in a while

80
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,200
So I wanna make sure somewhere
in this chicken scratch I
scribble and doodle

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Enough rhymes to maybe to try
and help get some people
through tough times

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,500
But I gotta keep a few
punchlines just in case cause
even you unsigned

83
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,900
Rappers are hungry looking at
me like it's lunchtime

84
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,900
I know there was a time where once I

85
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,700
Was king of the underground,
but I still rap like I'm on my
Pharoahe Monch grind

86
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,100
So I crunch rhymes, but
sometimes when you combine

87
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,700
Appeal with the skin color of mine

88
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
You get too big and here they
come trying to,

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,500
Censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from the
Marshall Mathers LP

90
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,100
One where I tried to say I
take seven kids from Columbine

91
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Put 'em all in a line, add an
AK-47, a revolver and a nine

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,800
See if I get away with it now
that I ain't as big as I was,
but I've

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,700
Morphed into an immortal
coming through the portal

94
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,100
You're stuck in a time warp
from 2004 though

95
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,700
And I don't know what the fuck
that you rhyme for

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,100
You're pointless as Rapunzel
with fucking cornrows

97
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,800
You're like normal, fuck being normal

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,300
And I just bought a new Raygun
from the future

99
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,600
To just come and shoot ya like
when Fabolous made Ray J mad

100
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
'Cause Fab said he looked like
a fag at Maywhether's pad

101
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,100
Singin' to a man while they played piano

102
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,500
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7
special on the cable channel

103
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,900
So Ray J went straight to the
radio station the very next
day

104
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,200
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"

105
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,200
Lyrics coming at you at
supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)

106
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,500
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you
assuming I'm a human

107
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
What I gotta do to get it
through to you I'm superhuman

108
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Innovative and I'm made of rubber

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,900
So that anything you saying
ricocheting off of me and
it'll glue to you

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,600
I'm never stating, more than
never demonstrating

111
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,500
How to give a motherfuckin'
audience a feeling like it's
levitating

112
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Never fading, and I know that
the haters are forever waiting

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
For the day that they can say
I fell off, they'd be
celebrating

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Cause I know the way to get
'em motivated

115
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,000
I make elevating music, you
make elevator music

116
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh, he's too mainstream

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,400
Well, that's what they do when
they get jealous, they confuse
it

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
It's not hip hop, it's pop,
cause I found a hella way to
fuse it

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
With rock, shock rap with Doc

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Throw on Lose Yourself and
make 'em lose it

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,500
I don't know how to make songs like that

122
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,900
I don't know what words to use

123
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Let me know when it occurs to you

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,100
While I'm ripping any one of
these verses diverse as you

125
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,400
It's curtains, I'm
inadvertently hurtin' you

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,100
How many verses I gotta murder to,

127
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Prove that if you're half as
nice at songs you can
sacrifice virgins too uh!

128
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,100
School flunkie, pill junky

129
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
But look at the accolades the
skills brung me

130
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
Full of myself, but still hungry

131
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,200
I bully myself cause I make me
do what I put my mind to

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
And I'm a million leagues
above you, ill when I speak in
tongues

133
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,500
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you

134
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm drunk so Satan take the
fucking wheel, I'm asleep in
the front seat

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys,
still chunky, but funky

136
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,200
But in my head there's
something I can feel tugging
and struggling

137
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,600
Angels fight with devils,
here's what they want from me

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,900
They asking me to eliminate
some of the women hate

139
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
But if you take into
consideration the bitter
hatred that I had

140
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Then you may be a little
patient and more sympathetic
to the situation

141
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,200
And understand the discrimination

142
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,500
But fuck it, life's handing
you lemons, make lemonade then

143
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,700
But if I can't batter the
women how the fuck am I
supposed to bake them a cake
then?

144
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,400
Don't mistake it for Satan

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
It's a fatal mistake if you
think I need to be overseas

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,400
And take a vacation to trip a broad

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,100
And make her fall on her face
and don't be a retard

148
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Be a king? Think not, why be a
king when you can be a God?

149
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:11,300
